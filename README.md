# No Fungal

**Version compatibility**: Tested and works with Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead `0.H (stable)` and recent experimental builds based on that structure.

## Description

This mod completely removes **fungal monsters** and **fungal-related overmap locations** from the game.

- 🧫 Removes all fungal species (`mon_fungaloid`, `mon_spore`, etc.)
- 🗺️ Blacklists overmap specials such as fungal forests and towers
- 🌍 Applies universal region override to prevent future fungal spawns

This is useful for players who want to disable the fungal infection mechanics and their biome entirely.

## Installation

1. Copy the `No_Fungal` folder into your `data/mods/` directory.
2. Enable `No Fungal` in the mod list when creating a new world.
3. **Note**: This mod must be enabled *before* world generation to be effective.
